    <p>DIAL transmits several types of information when necessary, all of which are used only to provide features to the user and not for tracking or analytics purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>If the Sidebar is enabled:</strong></p>
    <p>If you dont want your location to be used at all please disable the Sidebar option.</p>
    <p>If the option to use "force weather coordinate" is not enabled, DIAL sends the IP address from which the request was sent to a service provided by <a href="https://ipinfo.io/" target="_blank">ipinfo.io</a> in order to estimate the user's location; this estimate is then transmitted to <a href="https://darksky.net" target="_blank">Dark Sky</a> and displays the weather in your location. If you dont want your IP Address to be used, enable the coordinate option instead.</p>
    <p>If the option is set to use "force weather coordinate" for weather is enabled, DIAL uses the given values to determine the users location. After the location is set DIAL sends the coordinates to <a href="https://darksky.net" target="_blank">Dark Sky</a> and displays the weather conditions in your location.</p>
    <p>Once the user's location has been estimated or determined by the above means, DIAL will send the information to a service provided by <a href="https://darksky.net" target="_blank">Dark Sky</a> to retrieve the relevant weather conditions.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about the above you can contact me at: <a href="mailto:danlvovsky@gmail.com?subject=DIAL Privacy" target="_blank">danlvovsky@gmail.com</a></p>
